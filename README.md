## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Gemini Nano Setup Issues

#### "Prompt API not supported"
- Upgrade to Chrome 127+
- Try Chrome Dev/Canary/Beta
- Verify you enabled both required flags

#### "Gemini Nano is not available"
- Check flags are enabled correctly
- Restart Chrome after enabling flags
- Wait for model download to complete
- Verify in console: `await window.LanguageModel.availability()`

#### Model download stuck
- Keep Chrome running in foreground
- Check internet connection
- Ensure 1-2GB free disk space
- Check notifications for download progress

### Voice Recording Issues

#### Microphone permission denied
- Click the microphone icon in Chrome's address bar
- Select "Always allow" for this extension
- Reload the extension and try again

#### Recording fails or no audio captured
- Check if your microphone is working in other apps
- Try a different microphone if available
- Check Chrome's site settings (chrome://settings/content/microphone)

#### Transcription fails
- Ensure audio is clear and not too long (keep under 2 minutes)
- Speak clearly and at a moderate pace
- Check that Gemini Nano has audio input enabled

### Resume Parsing Issues

#### "Failed to parse resume"
- For PDF/DOCX: Ensure internet connection (uses cloud API)
- Try pasting the text directly instead
- For images: Ensure image is clear and text is readable

#### Text extraction incomplete
- Use high-resolution images
- Ensure good contrast between text and background
- Try uploading as PDF instead if available
- Manually paste missing sections

### Context Menu Not Working

#### Right-click menu doesn't show
- Refresh the webpage
- Make sure you've selected text before right-clicking
- Reload the extension (chrome://extensions → reload)

#### Side panel doesn't open
- Click the extension icon manually
- Check if popup blockers are interfering
- Try restarting Chrome

## 🔒 Privacy & Security

- ✅ **On-Device AI** - All AI processing (Gemini Nano) runs locally on your device

- ✅ **Privacy-First** - Job descriptions, answers, and feedback never leave your device
- ✅ **Microphone Permission** - Voice recording stays on-device, only you control it
